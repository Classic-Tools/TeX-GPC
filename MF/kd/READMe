The file kdlig.mf contains ligature programs for the "Classic Greek
Font" from K J Dryllerakis. This font "abuses" METAFONT's
ligatures to let you access 256 different character shapes from
the 95 visible 7 bit ASCII keys. 

Of course, I changed the allocation of some ligatures:
- `kh' prints `chi', `ph' prints `phi', `th' prints `theta' `ps' prints `psi'
- '` means ~, no need to change the catcode of ~.
- sigma and apostrophe at the end of a word are treated correctly.
  No need to use `c' for an end-sigma or '' (two apostrophes)for
  an apostrophe.

All of these changes are confined to one file, namely kdlig.mf.
To install it for TeX-GPC, get Drylleraki's kd*.mf files from
ctan:fonts/greek/kd/mf, and copy the .mf files to you master MFinputs
directory. (do not copy plain.mf!) Then prepare a working directory
for both TeX and MF (mk_TeX_dir, mk_MF_dir), copy the kdlig.mf from
this directory to your working directory and build a .tfm file:

	$ mkfont kdgr10
and a .pk file:
	$ mkpkfont kdgr10

The way MF-GPC searches for its input files it will read the modified
kdlig.mf from the working directory but all other kd-files from
MFinputs.

I provided a test file test.tex, some example files (sappho.tex,
solon.tex) and a file agr.tex that you might \input in your
ancient greek TeX files. Consult agr.tex for usage information.

Comments welcome!
