The files in this directory help to build Tom Rockiki's dvips for TeX-GPC.

Since KPSE does not blend with TeX-GPC, and CTAN only offers KPSE based
versions of DVIPS, I downloaded the latest release from Stanford:
     ftp ftp://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/pub/dvips/dvips576.tar.gz

It unpacks in a directory dvips576. Edit Makefile from this directory
to reflect the default resolution of your printer, the location
of your binary and "man" directory.

Replace Makefile and MakeTeXPK in dvips576/dvips by the files from
this directory. See xdvi/README for hints on the man directory.

Create a master directory DVIPSconf if you haven't done so already, goto
dvips576/dvips, run mk_TeX_dir, mk_MF_dir, and make install.

Edit DVIPSconf/config.ps to reflect paper size and resolution of
your printer.  To make dvips generate missing .pk fonts automatically,
the resolutions in config.ps and in the mf mode "localfont" must
agree.

Enjoy,
Wolfgang
