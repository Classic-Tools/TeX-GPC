The TRIP test nicely shows the sin of TeX-GPC: It does not trim trailing
spaces of input lines.
This is shown in trip.log.diff, the "**" line of TeX-GPC's log file
contains a space, whereas the original log file doesn't. Furthermore
the statistics the high water marks of the buffer stack differ by
one (113b not 114b) which is the trailing space.

TeX-GPC needs more strings and string characters than TeX because it
does not conserve string space.

These are all differences shown by the TRIP test, so TeX-GPC is
still pretty close to TeX.
